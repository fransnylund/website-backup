<h1 id="reasons-why-i-use-linux-instead-of-windows">21 Reasons Why I Use Linux Instead of Windows</h1>
<p class="date">Nov 15, 2021</p>
    <section class="text">
<p>There are a ton of reasons why I left the Windows world, and I’ve now compiled a list of the major reasons why I, and many other Linux users, choose to run a Linux system. I’m by no means <em>against</em> Windows. I just prefer Linux. I’ve wanted to write this for a while after getting more familiar and being able to wrap my head around Linux. I’ve probably made some mistakes(typos, etc) when writing this post, so feel free to correct me if I’m wrong so I can rectify it.</p>
<h1 id="free-and-open-source-software">1. Free and Open Source software</h1>
<p>Linux is hosted on GitHub and licensed under GPLv2. Anyone is free to inspect the source code, fork the project and make their modifications and share their modifications(as long as they abide by the license and keep the changes under GPLv2). Most programs that come preinstalled on Linux are also free and open-source. Firefox, GIMP and the LibreOffice suite are just a few examples.</p>
<p>Here’s the Linux kernel if you’re interested: <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">https://github.com/torvalds/linux</a></p>
<h1 id="free-in-terms-of-cost">2. Free in terms of cost</h1>
<p>Linux is also completely free of charge. There’s not much to say about this one. Everyone loves free stuff! You’ll also save money when it comes to the software as most programs that people run on Linux are also free of charge(GIMP, LibreOffice, and more), while the Windows alternatives are mostly paid for(Microsoft Word and Photoshop). You can of course get GIMP on Windows but how many Windows users actually use GIMP?</p>
<h1 id="full-control-over-your-operating-system">3. Full control over your operating system</h1>
<p>Imagine a system where you have full control over everything that’s running, and you have the power to uninstall <em>literally</em> anything(even the kernel). Yeah, that’s Linux. A true dream system! The thing about Windows is that you have no knowledge of what’s happening under the hood because of its closed-source nature. You can’t change the desktop environment much(just a tad), updates are usually forced, and there’s constant communication between Microsoft’s servers and your computer. Imagine using something that you barely have any control over!</p>
<h1 id="privacy">4. Privacy</h1>
<p>You know how macOS and Windows have tracking software and telemetry? Linux doesn’t. At least you can choose if you wish to enable any telemetry on distros like Ubuntu. This is one of the reasons we Linux users use free and open-source software. It’s so easy to read through the source code and check for unacceptable or malicious code. Also, any developer or developers that even tries to sneak in some kind of telemetry will be met with fury by the Linux community. Just look at what happened with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/audacity-privacy-policy-spyware-accusations-data-collection-210001803.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9odG1sLmR1Y2tkdWNrZ28uY29tLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANteXWUDk598eoml7N0hSAZsHfizrdnga8s22dKi73k6uI0VW_kKHUWpE-hQojt7heJgYndWmCPjZIEPamvJiBvHFpJy6zxz4SBP5YlAYZLQil3qimb7jl6ZAG3y1LkU2QonOYBDLcWrwMxNpqOmhummpTvop2L9KD6n4zMY2cNb">Audacity</a>.</p>
<h1 id="linux-can-run-on-a-myriad-of-different-computers">5. Linux can run on a myriad of different computers</h1>
<p>No matter if your computer is 10 or 15 years old, Linux probably supports it. Slow, old computers and rare architectures are all well-supported. ARM, MIPS, ARC, PowerPC, and many more. Here’s a list of all the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux-supported_computer_architectures">supported architectures</a>. I’ve seen many people speak happily about the fact that they were able to revive one of their old computers by switching to Linux after it had been running so slowly on Windows and the support had ended for that version of Windows.</p>
<h1 id="active-helpful-and-knowledgeable-community">6. Active, helpful, and knowledgeable community</h1>
<p>This is a big one. Pretty much all the major distros have a forum, an IRC chat and some even have Discord. There’s even a ton of people ready to help you on Reddit! The reason I love the community isn’t just because they are active and helpful, but because many are tech-savvy. It really feels like home for me to be around other geeks. Imagine being surrounded by a bunch of knowledgeable computer users. Sounds like heaven!</p>
<h1 id="terrific-for-programming">7. Terrific for programming</h1>
<p>Here’s a couple of reasons why programming on Linux is an absolute breeze:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supports a crap-load of programming languages? Check.</li>
<li>Has compilers and an assembler preinstalled? Check.</li>
<li>Has Bash so you can do Bash scripting? Check.</li>
<li>Capable of running git from the command line? Check.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think we can all agree that programming is great on Linux. I mean, I remember when I was 16 years old and solely used Linux in a VM because I wanted to play around with NASM and Bash.</p>
<h1 id="you-learn-how-the-computer-works">8. You learn how the computer works</h1>
<p>This is one of the main reasons I decided to start using Linux in the first place. I knew that if I learn Linux, I would learn <em>a lot</em> about how the computer works. This ended up being completely true. By installing distros like Arch and Gentoo, you will learn about partitioning a drive, what PGP is, what NTP is, CLI, ext4, Btrfs, FAT, package manager, the importance of fonts, shell, display server, sound server, kernel, and much, much more.</p>
<h1 id="stability">9. Stability</h1>
<p>Everyone loves high uptimes and as few crashes as possible. Linux is known for running and running, seemingly until the end of the universe, or until you get a kernel update. I’ve never had Linux crash on me, and I’ve had my computer running for weeks without restarting it. This was one of the main reasons Linux won in the server world. A server needs to be able to run 24/7 without restarting.</p>
<h1 id="customization">10. Customization</h1>
<p>Linux is infinitely customizable. You can completely customize the desktop to your liking. Have you dreamt about using a tiling window manager? Great! There are at least 10 out there for Linux. I’m currently using <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a>. There are also a ton of desktop environments available such as GNOME, KDE, XFCE, Cinnamon, Deepin, MATE, and like a couple of million other desktop environments. You can even make your own desktop environment!</p>
<h1 id="unlimited-choices">11. Unlimited choices</h1>
<p>There are so many distros out there. This gives the user a great deal of choice when it comes to choosing a distribution. Many are fairly similar, but some are quite different. Linux Mint and Ubuntu are easy to use and install. Arch and Gentoo are harder to install and allow you to learn how the computer works, and Void Linux and Alpine Linux can be chosen if you prefer to go without the GNU coreutils(Void has an option to install GNU stuff too). Devuan, Artix, Void and Gentoo are for the people that prefer another init system than systemd(Gentoo has an option for systemd as well), and so on.</p>
<h1 id="packaging">12. Packaging</h1>
<p>This one’s super nifty. Installing any program can be done with one short command and from just one place—the terminal. You don’t even have to open up a browser. Not only does this save a lot of time and searching for the right program, but it is also incredibly good when it comes to security which I will talk about in the next section. Also, updates can be done with one command, too.</p>
<h1 id="security">13. Security</h1>
<p>Let’s talk about security. While almost all operating systems are vulnerable, you’re far less likely to encounter malware in the wild when using Linux. Mainly, because there aren’t that many Linux users(roughly 2% in 2021). This means that it’s not worth the hackers’ time to create malware for Linux. Other reasons include: You never have to install <em>anything</em> from the web, and a lot of Linux users only install open-source software, which is objectively safer than closed-sourced software. This means that installing an anti-virus is somewhat useless. I’m not aware of a single Linux user that’s running an anti-virus on their Linux system.</p>
<h1 id="drivers-are-built-into-the-kernel">14. Drivers are built into the kernel</h1>
<p>Some people might be less fond of the drivers being built into the kernel, but I—for sure—love the idea. I love to just be able to plug in my mouse and keyboard, and maybe a controller, and have everything just work out of the box without having to install any drivers.</p>
<h1 id="learning-linux-will-teach-you-about-unix">15. Learning Linux will teach you about Unix</h1>
<p>This one’s often overlooked. Did you know that learning Linux will make you a decent terminal user on macOS, all the BSD systems, and other Unix(and Unix-like) systems? After learning Linux, I could easily navigate and use FreeBSD, which is an OS I ended up really liking! You’ll also understand the UNIX philosophy such as “Do one thing well and make sure it integrates with other programs.”</p>
<h1 id="you-will-get-familiar-with-web-servers">16. You will get familiar with web servers</h1>
<p>Because Linux is so popular in the server space, you’ll feel just like at home after ssh’ing into your brand new web server. It’s the same old terminal window that comes up. Almost every command that you’re using on the desktop can easily be used on the server. Heck, I even thought I was using my local computer when I was ssh’ed into my server once. How embarrassing!</p>
<h1 id="powerful-terminal">17. Powerful terminal</h1>
<p>I know that a lot of people <em>really</em> like GUIs, and that’s fine. But you can’t argue about terminals being bad when it comes to speed and the fact that you can control every part of your computer from just one place, the terminal! You can update, shutdown, restart, install, remove, delete, change configs and do pretty much everything from the terminal. In Windows, these are all separate programs and menus that you have to open up. The command prompt in Windows has its limits.</p>
<h1 id="you-can-run-linux-from-a-usb-stick">18. You can run Linux from a USB stick</h1>
<p>That’s right. You don’t even have to <em>install</em> Linux to be able to use it. You can just plug in a thumb drive into your computer and use it as any other operating system. Puppy Linux is famous for working great with its small footprint on something like a USB stick.</p>
<h1 id="non-forced-and-frequent-updates">19. Non-forced and frequent updates</h1>
<p>I think we can all agree that Windows randomly forcing you to do a hefty update and restart your operating system isn’t ideal. I mean, who actually owns the computer? Why can’t the user decide when and what to update? Linux is different. Updating everything is one short command and no restart is required(unless it’s a kernel update where you might want to restart).</p>
<h1 id="reduces-e-waste">20. Reduces E-Waste</h1>
<p>That’s right. You’re saving the <a href="https://idm.net.au/blog/006200-linux-reduces-e-waste">planet by using Linux</a>. Yay! This has to do with the fact that the average lifespan of a Windows PC is shorter than a computer running Linux. This is mainly caused by the constant increase in system requirements for every new Windows release and the speed decrement that Windows suffers from which I will talk about in the next section.</p>
<h1 id="linux-doesnt-get-slower-over-time">21. Linux doesn’t get slower over time</h1>
<p>Does anyone remember those registry cleaning programs? Or fragmentation issues that Windows has? Yeah, those things really affect the speed of the operating system. Uninstalled software on Windows—that for some reason didn’t get fully uninstalled—also contributes to a sluggish Windows system. Linux doesn’t have this issue(at least none of my systems have had these problems).</p>
<h1 id="to-wrap-it-all-up">To wrap it all up</h1>
<p>Hopefully, this list serves as food for thought for the people thinking about switching over to Linux. I bet there’s even more than these 21 reason—but I feel like these are the main ones. I left out some smaller things like the ability to unbind and rebind keys, the ability to select text and paste with the middle mouse button, etc. You are free to compose your own list of reasons to use Linux. This is my list! Anyway, Linux is a wonderful and free system where you have unlimited options and full control over your own system. Everyone deserves a great operating system. Once again, I’m not against Windows. I use it in school, but I think everyone should give Linux a whirl. It’s free after all, so it’s not like you’re losing anything when switching over to it.</p>
