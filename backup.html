	<h2> Wecome </h2>
	<p> Welcome to my website! This is my tech blog site which is mostly focused on programming, computers and Linux. I might throw in some slightly off-topic posts every now and then, though. This website does <em>not</em> use JavaScript and does <em>not</em> have ads, trackers or other annoyances. This is a simple, clean, minimalistic, and content-focused site, which I'm very proud of.</p>
	<h2> About Me</h2>
	<p> I'm Frans, a 21-year-old tech guy from Finland, and I've created this site so I can easily share my thoughts and write different types of posts. I'm proficient in C, C++, Python, HTML and CSS. I also have experience with x86 Assembly, C# and Unity. My go-to Operating System is Linux. I find it the best and most efficient OS you can use.</p>
