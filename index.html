	<h2> Wecome </h2>
	<section class="text">
	<p> Welcome to my website! This is my brand new tech/blog site which will be mostly focused on programming, computers and Linux. I might throw in some slightly off-topic posts every now and then, though. This website is free of ads, trackers and JavaScript. I will probably do something with JavaScript in the future—but for now—it's not required.

		<h2> About Me</h2>
	<p> I'm Frans, a 21-year-old tech guy, and I've created this site so I can easily share my thoughts and write different types of posts. I'm proficient in C, C++, Python, Bash scripting, HTML and CSS. I also have experience with x86 Assembly, C# and Unity. My go-to operating system is Linux. I find it the best and most efficient OS you can use. I also like reading books and learning new things!</p>
