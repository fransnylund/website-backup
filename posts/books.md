# Programming and Tech Books That I Recommend

Recently, and for the past year or two, I have read some well-written and educative ebooks about a variety of computer related topics. I have decided to compose a list of all the ones I remember reading. These books are all completely free of charge and available for reading by simply clicking on the link. The link will take you to a PDF that you can either read of even download if you desire. The books are ordered by programming language/subject. I will regularly update this list as I am an avid reader and I would like to see this list grow. If you wish to browse a complete list of free programming books, I recommend checking out [free-programming-books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/books/free-programming-books-langs.md) on GitHub.
