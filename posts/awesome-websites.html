<h1>Awesome websites</h1>
<p class="date">Nov 1, 2021</p>
    <section class="text">
    <p> Here are some of my absolute favorite websites that I regulary use. They're all completely free to use and extremely informative and have the potential to make you a more knowledgeable human being. Image saying "no" to that!</p>
    <h2><a href="https://www.vocabulary.com">www.vocabulary.com</a></h2>
    <p> You know when you read about a word in the dictionary and the explanation sucks, there's barely any good examples and the way it's written is quite formal. Well, vocabulary.com is different! It has really nice and simple definitions with real world examples, like in which situations you're most likely to hear a particular word and how that word is usually used, etc. The examples provided can also be hilarious, so you even get a free laugh while learning, how nice!</p>
    <h2><a href="https://www.techterms.com">www.techterms.com</a></h2>
    <p> This one's really handy. I think we all know how much computer jargon and tech terms are thrown around every day. Luckly, there's a site that -- pretty much -- has all the terms in one giant searchable dictionary, techterms.com. I first started using this website like half a decade ago, and I still find myself looking for definitions for some obscure tech-related word every now and then. Awesome site. Check it out.</p>
    <h2><a href="https://beej.us/guide/">beej.us/guide</a></h2>
    <p> Beej's a writer who writes with a clear and easy-to-understand language. He also manages to pop some humor into his writings. What an amazing writer, really. I'm personally a huge fan of this guy. I read through most of his C programming ebook and I absolutely <em>loved</em> it. I'm so looking forward to reading his Python book when I have more time. I highly recommend his books if you're into computer stuff. He even has a photo guide!</p>
    <h2><a href="https://tldp.org">tldp.org</a></h2>
    <p> TLDP, The Linux Documentation Project, has ebooks, guides and tutorials on a host of things regarding Linux. Everything from basic Bash scripting ebooks to advanced kernel hacking guides. I've read at least two ebooks on this site, and I will gladly read more in the upcoming future. I think this site is great for beginners who want to get into the world of Linux.</p>
    <h2><a href="https://www.typing.academy">www.typing.academy</a></h2>
    <p> Did you know that <em>everyone</em>(who can) should type with all of their 10 fingers, instead of like 4 - 6 fingers which many people do? I've had this problem myself. So I set about to find a website that could magically reprogram my fingers' muscle memory and remotely control my brain and... Just kidding. I simply bumped into this site called typing.academy where you get to learn how to type with all 10 fingers for free! It felt super weird in the beginning but trust me,  after you get used to typing with 10 fingers, you will be typing like a maniac! The reason I mentioned this site here is because typing fast with all your 10 fingers is actually <em>very</em> important. The faster you type, the more things you'll get done on the computer in a shorter period of time.</p>
