<h1 id="programming-and-tech-books-that-i-recommend">Programming and tech books that I recommend</h1>
<p>Recently, and for the past year or two, I have read some well-written and educative ebooks about a variety of computer related topics. I have decided to compose a list of all the ones I remember reading. These books are all completely free of charge and available for reading by simply clicking on the link. The link will take you to a PDF that you can either read of even download if you desire. The books are ordered by programming language/subject. I will regularly update this list as I am an avid reader and I would like to see this list grow. If you wish to browse a complete list of free programming books, I recommend checking out <a href="https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/main/books/free-programming-books-langs.md">free-programming-books</a> on GitHub.</p>
