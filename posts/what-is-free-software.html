<p class="date">Jan 23, 2022</p>
<p>Free software is software that respects the users’ freedom by allowing the users four freedoms:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>To run the program as they wish.</li>
<li>To study and change the program in source code form.</li>
<li>To redistribute exact copies.</li>
<li>To distribute modified versions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Free software has <em>nothing</em> to do with the price of a particular software. In fact, free software can be paid for. It’s, as they say, free as in free speech not as in free beer. It really should be called freedom software or something else. It confuses the crap out of newcomers. I’m not a <em>huge</em> free software fanatic, but I do use mostly free software and avoid proprietary software. The problem with being 100% free software is that you <strong>really</strong> have to compromise convenience for that to happen. I mean, for example, the creator(Richard Stallman) has newer used a proprietary system(Windows, MacOS, etc). He doesn’t use a cellphone or a credit card. He also always uses TOR and use LibreJS which blocks minified JavaScript. You can check out his website <a href="here.">https://stallman.org/</a></p>
<p>The FSF(Free Software Foundation) started in 1985 by Richard Stallman. As some of you might know, Unix was at the time proprietary(and some Unix versions are still). You had to buy the first versions of Unix if you wanted to use it. This then led to Richard creating the Free Software Foundation and the GNU project, which goal were to make a free operating system. By 1991, they almost had an entire operating system built that was completely free from Unix code but still Unix-like. They were only missing one, essential, piece – the kernel. Luckly, Linus Torvalds created a kernel at around the same time and soon after that there was a completely free operating system known as GNU/Linux. A lot of people call it Linux, but it’s correctly called GNU/Linux(provided that the coreutils and the other GNU stuff are installed). Alpine Linux doesn’t use any of the GNU tools, so you would be incorrect calling that GNU/Linux. People just call it Linux because it’s both shorter and easier to pronounce.</p>
<p>While it has nothing to do with Open-source software, the two movements sometimes overlap. Something that’s free software also falls into the open-source category. It’s about the movement and the reason behind the licenses that differ. Both Open-source and Free software has their own requirements that have to be followed for developers to call something either open-source or free software.</p>
<p>Note: If you want to refer to software that doesn’t cost anything, use the term “freeware”.</p>
<p>Here are some popular free software programs:</p>
<p><a href="LibreOffice">https://github.com/LibreOffice</a></p>
<p><a href="GIMP">https://www.gimp.org/</a></p>
<p><a href="Brave">https://github.com/brave/brave-browser</a></p>
<p><a href="Apache">https://github.com/apache/httpd</a></p>
<p><a href="OBS">https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio</a></p>
<p><a href="Blender">https://github.com/blender/blender</a></p>
<p><a href="Latex">https://github.com/latex3/</a></p>
<p>Again, these programs just happen to cost nothing. They could easily make it cost money and still be called free software.</p>
