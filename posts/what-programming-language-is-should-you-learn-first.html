<h1 id="what-programming-language-should-you-learn-first">What programming language should you learn first?</h1>
<p class="date">Dec 19, 2021</p>
<p>If you’re new to programming, you’ve probably been overwhelmed by the amount of different programming languages in use. It might be hard to know where to start off. Some say it doesn’t matter what the first language is, others say “pick Python!”, and some say “Javascript is the best” Well, I’m here to share my opinion, and I think picking your first programming language is important.</p>
<h2 id="best-programming-language-for-everything">Best Programming Language for everything</h2>
<p>First of all, there’s no “best” programming language for everything. No programming language covers everything. You can’t make a triple A game with SQL for instance, and making websites with C isn’t great either. But we are not here to talk about the best language; we are here to talk about the best language to learn <strong>first</strong>. Some say that “It doesn’t matter what your first programming language is”. I completely disagree. Your first programming language will give you a mental picture of what programming is. It will also be the one that you will remember the best. A good analogy would be each person’s native language. They speak it the best and they will always remember it — programming languages is, at least for me, similar. In addition, choosing the right language will teach you <strong>why</strong> things are done the way they are done in higher level languages.</p>
<p>When you google “What programming language should I learn first”, you will usually get one of the following: Python, JavaScript, C++, Ruby, etc… None of these are really ideal, especially if you want to understand the important concepts of programming and how computers work. They also employ OOP(Object Oriented Programming), which usually confuses beginners. Stay away from OOP if you if you’re just a beginner. I recommend starting with a procedular language. Treat OOP as a “next level” thing and keep things simple in order to avoid bafflement.</p>
<h2 id="learn-c">Learn C</h2>
<p>Starting with C is a great choice in my opinion. You may disagree — and that’s fine. Many others would agree with me that choosing C as your first language is a wise choice. I’ve seen posts recommending C, a teacher recommending it and mentors recommending it. C will expose you to all the basic high-level concepts. For example, it’s staticly typed so datatypes will get ingrained in your head pretty good. Both Python and Javascript abstract these away a bit by you not having to speciy the datatype(dynamically typed). C also teaches you about pointers which both Python and Javascript also abstract away. You will also learn a lot about memory, memory allocation and different types of memory sections. The other thing with C is that, because so many languages are based on C, your knowledge in C will apply to many other languages. You will see similarities in C++, C#, Java, etc. For instance, because I know C, I know how to make loops, switch statments, if statements, enums, structs and more in both C++ and C#. If you learn Python first, you probably wouldn’t be able to do that. C also makes it 100 times more easier to understand assembly languages as it’s very close to assembly.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-dont-really-care">If You Don’t Really Care</h2>
<p>Of course, if you only want to program and don’t care about <strong>how</strong> things are done under the hood — you might as well go for Python, JavaScript or something else. Oddly, many people choose their first language based on the average salary for that language in the work field or how “easy” it is. Both of which I don’t understand. What does money have to do with anything? If you are only after money, and you’re not passionate about programming, you will probably have a hard time. I recommend doing something that you are passionate about in life. Something being hard is also not a good argument. Not only is C <strong>not</strong> hard but even if it were hard, it would still teach you the fundamentals of programming.</p>
<h2 id="other-languages-to-consider-or-not-to-consider">Other Languages to Consider or Not to Consider</h2>
<p>C++ - I wouldn’t recommend, mainly for the OOP. In addition to having OOP, many say it’s an overcomplicated language. I just personally feel like it’s a <strong>huge</strong> language. C# - It enforces OOP and is similar to Java. Not the best for a beginner but if you have to, go for it. Java - Same as the above. Haskell - Hell no. I’ve edited config files in this language. It’s a pain. Assembly - Stay far away. Assembly languages have the steepest learning curve.</p>
<p>I don’t have any experience with other type of programming languages, so I can’t state my opinion on other languages.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2>
<p>Learn C — you won’t regret it. Python, Java and C# are <strong>okay</strong> to start with, but worse than C.</p>
